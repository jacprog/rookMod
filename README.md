My rook Mod with motor on bottom
based on https://youtu.be/JbOr9a6ECg8
made changes to have motors on bottom end and bed with bearings on diagonal. Also 2 Z screw on same diagonal to minimize binding

there is a 40/40 fan for extruder cooling, a 5015 for part coooling
XY motors are at bottom for stability
Z motors on a digonal, aligned with the bearings to prevent binding, 2 bearings on each rod for stability
Bed is garolite G10, and I plan to make it heatable
Rignt now printer is in PLA, but remaking all parts in PETG
Bottom box for electronics might need more work
